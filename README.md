## Introduction to JSX

- _Note_
  - Add Prettier
    - [Using Prettier with VS Code and Create React App](https://medium.com/technical-credit/using-prettier-with-vs-code-and-create-react-app-67c2449b9d08)
    - [VSCode Workspace Settings](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/settings)
- 13
  - The HTML attributes replaced by JSX follow a camelCase convention (e.g., `className`).
- Exercises
  - [Introductin JSX](https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html)
    - When splitting JSX across multiple lines, consider wrapping it in parentheses to avoid automatic semicolon insertion.
    - By default, React DOM escapes any values embedded in JSX before rendering them. Thus it ensures that you can never inject anything thatâ€™s not explicitly written in your application. Everything is converted to a string before being rendered. This helps prevent XSS (cross-site-scripting) attacks.

## ReactDOM

- 14
  - `ReactDOM.render()` uses a DOM node in your HTML to replace it with JSX. It's a way to integrate React in any foreign application easily, adn you can use `ReactDOM.render()` mltiple times across your application.
    - 2 arguments:
      - first argument is for rendering the JSX
      - second argument si the place where the React app hooks into your HTML

## Hot Module Replacement

- 17
  - Enable Hot Module Replacement (HMR) in _src/index.js_: `if (module.hot) {module.hot.accept(); }`
    - Prevents page refresh while developing - can maintain application state.

## Complex JavaScript in JSX

- 21
  - Assign a key to each list element so React can identify modified items when the list changes.
    - Use a stable identifier, not the index (which would not be stable if the list changes its order).
- Exercises
  - [List and Keys](https://reactjs.org/docs/lists-and-keys.html)
    - If no explicit key is assigned, React will default to using indexes as keys.
    - Rule of thumb: Use a `key` inside a `map()`.
    - `props.key` does not get passed to the component.
  - [Array](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array)
  - [Deep Dive into JavaScript's Array Map Method](https://www.robinwieruch.de/javascript-map-array/)
    - `map()` takes 3 arguments: value, index, array
    - Use `forEach()` when we don't need to do anything with the return values of its callback function; use `map()` otherwise.
    - With `reduce()`, whatever you return from the callback function will be used as the accumulator argument in the callback for the next iteration.
      - Since `reduce()` can work with any data structure, we could use `reduce()` to do the exact same thing as `map()`.
    - `reverse()` mutates the original array.
      - If this is not desired, use `map()` first (if transforming the values) or `slice()` (if no transformation necessary).
    - `Object.entries()` (ES2017) retuns a two-dimensional array of an object's keys and values.
    - If you want to transform data and create a new object, use `reduce()`.
    - Use `flatMap()` (ES2019) to flatten a multidimensional array into a single-dimensional array of transformed values. (`reduce()` can be used for the same purpose)
    - Since `map()` is only an Array method, an error will be thrown if you end up calling `map()` on a null or Object value.
      - To avoid calling `map()` on a null value, consider using `(originalArray || []).map()`.
    - To log a value in a single-line `map()`, add `console.log(value) || <operations>`, since `console.log()` returns `undefined`.

## ES6 Arrow Functions

- 23
  - An arrow function's parentheses are unnecessary when dealing with only a single argument.
- 24
  - In a concise body, an implicit return is attached.
- Exercises
  - [Arrow functions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/Arrow_functions)
    - An arrow function does not provide its own bindings to `this`, `arguments`, `super`, or `new.target`.

## ES6 Classes

- 26
  - The `render()` method of a class component must be overridden (because it defines the output of a React `Component`).
- Exercises
  - [JavaScript fundamentals before learning React](https://www.robinwieruch.de/javascript-fundamentals-react-requirements/)
    - Returning `null` is a valid way to display nothing in a component.
    - When something is exported as the `default`, no curly braces are needed when importing it.
  - [Classes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes)

# Basics in React

## Local Component State

- 29
  - Calling `super(props)` in a class component constructor is mandatory. It sets `this.props` in the constructor.
- 30
  - Every time the local component stat is changed, `render()` runs again.
- 31
  - Do not mutate the state directly. Use `setState()`.
- Exercises
  - [Constructor](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes#Constructor)

## ES6 Object Initializer

- 32
  - Shorthand in ES6 to initialize objects.
    - Instead of...
    ```
    const user = {
      name: name,
    }
    ```
    - ...we can (if the property name in the object matches the variable name)...
    ```
    const user = {
      name,
    }
    ```
- 33
  - ES6 allows computed property names.
- Exercises
  - [Object initializer](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Object_initializer)
    - Duplicate property names are allowed; the second will overwrite the first.

## Unidirectional Data Flow

- 35
  - Binding a function in a constructor: `this.onDismiss = this.onDismiss.bind(this);`
- 38
  - Unidirectional data flow of React:
    - An action is triggered in the view layer
    - A function or class method modifies the local component state
    - The `render()` method of the component runs and updates the view.
- Exercises
  - [State and Lifecycle](https://reactjs.org/docs/state-and-lifecycle.html)
    - 5 steps to convert a function component to a class:
      - 1: Create an ES6 class with the same name, extending `React.Component`
      - 2: Add a single empty `render()` method.
      - 3: Move the body of the function inside `render()`.
      - 4: Replace `props` with `this.props` in the `render()` body.
      - 5: Delete the remaining empty function declaration.
    - 3 steps to move `date` from props to a state:
      - 1: Replace `this.props.date` with `this.state.data` in `render()`.
      - 2: Add a class constructor that sets the initial `this.state`.
      - 3: Remove the `date` prop.
    - Mounting: When a component is rendered to the DOM for the first time.
      - `componentDidMount()`
    - Unmounting: When a component is removed from the DOM.
      - `componentWillUnmount()`
    - 3 things to know about `setState()`:
      - 1: Do not modify the state directly
      - 2: State updates may be asynchronous
        - React may batch multiple calls into a single update.
        - Consider using a second form of `setState()` that accepts a function. The function receives the previous state as its first argument and the props at the time of update as the second argument.
      - 3: State updates are (shallowly) merged
      - The data flows down
        - Neither the parent nor the child should know or care whether a certain component is stateful or stateless or is defined as a function or a class.

## Bindings

- 39
  - Class methods don't automatically bind `this` to the class instance.
- 41
  - Don't bind class methods inside `render()`; it will bind every time the component updates and hurt performance.
  - Don't define functions inside the constructor; the constructor should just be used for instantiating the class and its properties, not for business logic.
- 42

  - Class methods can be autobound with ES6 arrow functions.

    - E.g.,

    ```
    onClickMe = () => {
      console.log(this);
    }
    ```

    - vs.

    ```
    constructor() {
      super();

      this.onClickMe = this.onClickMe.bind(this);
    }

    onClickMe() {
      console.log(this);
    }
    ```

  - Though note that the official React documentation uses the class method bindings in the constructor.

- Exercises
  - [react-alternative-class-component-syntax](https://github.com/the-road-to-learn-react/react-alternative-class-component-syntax)
    - Class field declarations: can initialize local state without using the constructor, and declare class methods by arrow functions without also needing to bind them.

## Event Handler

- 44
  - A function must be passed to an event handler. (I.e., the expression needs to return a function, not just be a function.)
- 48
  - Using arrow functions in event handlers impacts performance. Every time `render()` runs, the handler instantiates the higher-order arrow function.
    - If this is a concern (in data-intense applications), consider implementing a dedicated component to bind the method in the constructor. For most applications, this is premature optimization.

## Interactions with Forms and Events

- 49
  - We use synthetic events to access values in an event payload.
- 50
  - When using a handler in your element, you get access to the synthetic React event in your callback function's signature (e.g., `onSearchChange(event)`).
- 52
  - `this.setState()` is a shallow merge, preserving the sibling properties.
- 53
  - Higher-order function: Passing a value into a function which then returns a new function
- Exercises
  - [Handling Events](https://reactjs.org/docs/handling-events.html)
    - Differences betweeen events from React elements and events from DOM elements:
      - React events are named using camelCase (instead of lowercase)
      - For JSX, pass a function as the event handler (instead of a string)
      - You cannot return `false` to prevent default behavior.
        - `preventDefault` must be called explicitly.
      - You should not need to call `addEventListener` - should just be able to provide a listner when the element is initially rendered.
    - Generally, if you refer to a method without `()` (e.g., `onClick={this.handleClick})`), you should bind that method.
    - Two ways to get around binding:
      - 1: Use the (experimental, but enabled by default with Create React App) public class fields syntax.
      - 2: Use an arrow function in the callback.
        - Though this creates a different callback each time. This may cause extra re-rendering for lower components. As a result, prefer either binding methods in the constructor or using the class fields syntax.
  - [Higher-order function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higher-order_function)
    - A higher-order function (known, in mathematics, as an _operator_ or a _functional_) does at least one of the following:
      - 1: Takes a function as an argument
      - 2: Returns a function
    - All other fuctions are first-order functions.

## ES6 Destructuring

- Exercises

  - [Destructuring assignment](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Destructuring_assignment)

    - Handy for swapping variables: `[a, b] = [b, a]`
    - When using object literal destructuring assignment without a declaration, parentheses are required:
      ```
      var a, b;
      ({a, b} = {a: 1, b: 2});
      ```
      - vs. `{a, b} = {a: 1, b: 2}`
        - `{a, b}` is evaluated as a block and not an object literal.
    - Destructuring can be used to unpack a property from an object and assign it to a variable with a different name.

      ```
      var o = {p: 42, q: true};
      var {p: foo, q: bar} = o;

      console.log(foo); // 42
      console.log(bar); // true
      ```

    - Nested object and array destructuring:

      ```
      const metadata = {
        title: 'Scratchpad',
        translations: [
          {
            locale: 'de',
            localization_tags: [],
            last_edit: '2014-04-14T08:43:37',
            url: '/de/docs/Tools/Scratchpad',
            title: 'JavaScript-Umgebung'
          }
        ],
        url: '/en-US/docs/Tools/Scratchpad'
      };

      let {
        title: englishTitle, // rename
        translations: [
          {
            title: localeTitle, // rename
          },
        ],
      } = metadata;

      console.log(englishTitle); // "Scratchpad"
      console.log(localeTitle);  // "JavaScript-Umgebung"
      ```

## Controlled Components

- 59
  - Form elements (`<input>`, `<textarea>`, `<select>`) hold their own state in plan HTML.
    - These are considered uncontrolled components, because they handle their own state.
    - In React, we only want controlled components.
      - To achieve this, we set the `value` attribute of the field.
- Exercises
  - [Forms](https://reactjs.org/docs/forms.html)
    - Controlled component: A element whose value is controlled by React (via `setState()`).
    - With a controlled component, every stat mutation will have an associated handler function.
    - In HTML, a `<textarea>` element is defined by its children; in React, it uses a `value` attribute.
    - Instead of adding a `selected` attribute on an `<option>` child of a `<select>` element, React uses a `value` attribute on the `<select>` element itself.
    - A file input tag (`<input type="file" />`) is an uncontrolled component, since it's read-only.
    - [Formik](https://jaredpalmer.com/formik) offers a complete form solution, including validation, tracking visited fields, and handling submission.
      - It's built on the same principles as controlled components.
