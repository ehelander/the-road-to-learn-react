    - [VSCode Workspace Settings](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/settings)
- 13
  - The HTML attributes replaced by JSX follow a camelCase convention (e.g., `className`).
- Exercises
  - [Introductin JSX](https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html)
    - When splitting JSX across multiple lines, consider wrapping it in parentheses to avoid automatic semicolon insertion.
    - By default, React DOM escapes any values embedded in JSX before rendering them. Thus it ensures that you can never inject anything thatâ€™s not explicitly written in your application. Everything is converted to a string before being rendered. This helps prevent XSS (cross-site-scripting) attacks.

## Complex JavaScript in JSX

- 21
  - Assign a key to each list element so React can identify modified items when the list changes.
    - Use a stable identifier, not the index (which would not be stable if the list changes its order).
- Exercises
  - [List and Keys](https://reactjs.org/docs/lists-and-keys.html)
    - If no explicit key is assigned, React will default to using indexes as keys.
    - Rule of thumb: Use a `key` inside a `map()`.
    - `props.key` does not get passed to the component.
  - [Array](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array)
  - [Deep Dive into JavaScript's Array Map Method](https://www.robinwieruch.de/javascript-map-array/)
    - `map()` takes 3 arguments: value, index, array
    - Use `forEach()` when we don't need to do anything with the return values of its callback function; use `map()` otherwise.
    - With `reduce()`, whatever you return from the callback function will be used as the accumulator argument in the callback for the next iteration.
      - Since `reduce()` can work with any data structure, we could use `reduce()` to do the exact same thing as `map()`.
    - `reverse()` mutates the original array.
      - If this is not desired, use `map()` first (if transforming the values) or `slice()` (if no transformation necessary).
    - `Object.entries()` (ES2017) retuns a two-dimensional array of an object's keys and values.
    - If you want to transform data and create a new object, use `reduce()`.
    - Use `flatMap()` (ES2019) to flatten a multidimensional array into a single-dimensional array of transformed values. (`reduce()` can be used for the same purpose)
    - Since `map()` is only an Array method, an error will be thrown if you end up calling `map()` on a null or Object value.
      - To avoid calling `map()` on a null value, consider using `(originalArray || []).map()`.
    - To log a value in a single-line `map()`, add `console.log(value) || <operations>`, since `console.log()` returns `undefined`.

## ES6 Arrow Functions

- 23
  - An arrow function's parentheses are unnecessary when dealing with only a single argument.
- 24
  - In a concise body, an implicit return is attached.
- Exercises
  - [Arrow functions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/Arrow_functions)
    - An arrow function does not provide its own bindings to `this`, `arguments`, `super`, or `new.target`.

## ES6 Classes

- 26
  - The `render()` method of a class component must be overridden (because it defines the output of a React `Component`).
- Exercises
  - [JavaScript fundamentals before learning React](https://www.robinwieruch.de/javascript-fundamentals-react-requirements/)
    - Returning `null` is a valid way to display nothing in a component.
    - When something is exported as the `default`, no curly braces are needed when importing it.
  - [Classes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes)

# Basics in React

## Local Component State

- 29
  - Calling `super(props)` in a class component constructor is mandatory. It sets `this.props` in the constructor.
- 30
  - Every time the local component stat is changed, `render()` runs again.
- 31
  - Do not mutate the state directly. Use `setState()`.
- Exercises
  - [Constructor](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes#Constructor)

## ES6 Object Initializer

- 32
  - Shorthand in ES6 to initialize objects.
    - Instead of...
    ```
    const user = {
      name: name,
    }
    ```
    - ...we can (if the property name in the object matches the variable name)...
    ```
    const user = {
      name,
    }
    ```
- 33
  - ES6 allows computed property names.
- Exercises
  - [Object initializer](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Object_initializer)
    - Duplicate property names are allowed; the second will overwrite the first.

## Unidirectional Data Flow

- 35
  - Binding a function in a constructor: `this.onDismiss = this.onDismiss.bind(this);`
- 38
  - Unidirectional data flow of React:
    - An action is triggered in the view layer
    - A function or class method modifies the local component state
    - The `render()` method of the component runs and updates the view.
- Exercises
  - [State and Lifecycle](https://reactjs.org/docs/state-and-lifecycle.html)
    - 5 steps to convert a function component to a class:
      - 1: Create an ES6 class with the same name, extending `React.Component`
      - 2: Add a single empty `render()` method.
      - 3: Move the body of the function inside `render()`.
      - 4: Replace `props` with `this.props` in the `render()` body.
      - 5: Delete the remaining empty function declaration.
    - 3 steps to move `date` from props to a state:
      - 1: Replace `this.props.date` with `this.state.data` in `render()`.
      - 2: Add a class constructor that sets the initial `this.state`.
      - 3: Remove the `date` prop.
    - Mounting: When a component is rendered to the DOM for the first time.
      - `componentDidMount()`
    - Unmounting: When a component is removed from the DOM.
      - `componentWillUnmount()`
    - 3 things to know about `setState()`:
      - 1: Do not modify the state directly
      - 2: State updates may be asynchronous
        - React may batch multiple calls into a single update.
        - Consider using a second form of `setState()` that accepts a function. The function receives the previous state as its first argument and the props at the time of update as the second argument.
      - 3: State updates are (shallowly) merged
      - The data flows down
        - Neither the parent nor the child should know or care whether a certain component is stateful or stateless or is defined as a function or a class.

## Bindings

- 39
  - Class methods don't automatically bind `this` to the class instance.
- 41
  - Don't bind class methods inside `render()`; it will bind every time the component updates and hurt performance.
  - Don't define functions inside the constructor; the constructor should just be used for instantiating the class and its properties, not for business logic.
- 42

  - Class methods can be autobound with ES6 arrow functions.

    - E.g.,

    ```
    onClickMe = () => {
      console.log(this);
    }
    ```

    - vs.

    ```
    constructor() {
      super();

      this.onClickMe = this.onClickMe.bind(this);
    }

    onClickMe() {
      console.log(this);
    }
    ```

  - Though note that the official React documentation uses the class method bindings in the constructor.

- Exercises
  - [react-alternative-class-component-syntax](https://github.com/the-road-to-learn-react/react-alternative-class-component-syntax)
    - Class field declarations: can initialize local state without using the constructor, and declare class methods by arrow functions without also needing to bind them.

## Event Handler

- 44
  - A function must be passed to an event handler. (I.e., the expression needs to return a function, not just be a function.)
- 48
  - Using arrow functions in event handlers impacts performance. Every time `render()` runs, the handler instantiates the higher-order arrow function.
    - If this is a concern (in data-intense applications), consider implementing a dedicated component to bind the method in the constructor. For most applications, this is premature optimization.

## Interactions with Forms and Events

- 49
  - We use synthetic events to access values in an event payload.
- 50
  - When using a handler in your element, you get access to the synthetic React event in your callback function's signature (e.g., `onSearchChange(event)`).
- 52
  - `this.setState()` is a shallow merge, preserving the sibling properties.
- 53
  - Higher-order function: Passing a value into a function which then returns a new function
- Exercises
  - [Handling Events](https://reactjs.org/docs/handling-events.html)
    - Differences betweeen events from React elements and events from DOM elements:
      - React events are named using camelCase (instead of lowercase)
      - For JSX, pass a function as the event handler (instead of a string)
      - You cannot return `false` to prevent default behavior.
        - `preventDefault` must be called explicitly.
      - You should not need to call `addEventListener` - should just be able to provide a listner when the element is initially rendered.
    - Generally, if you refer to a method without `()` (e.g., `onClick={this.handleClick})`), you should bind that method.
    - Two ways to get around binding:
      - 1: Use the (experimental, but enabled by default with Create React App) public class fields syntax.
      - 2: Use an arrow function in the callback.
        - Though this creates a different callback each time. This may cause extra re-rendering for lower components. As a result, prefer either binding methods in the constructor or using the class fields syntax.
  - [Higher-order function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higher-order_function)
    - A higher-order function (known, in mathematics, as an _operator_ or a _functional_) does at least one of the following:
      - 1: Takes a function as an argument
      - 2: Returns a function
    - All other fuctions are first-order functions.

## ES6 Destructuring

- Exercises

  - [Destructuring assignment](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Destructuring_assignment)

    - Handy for swapping variables: `[a, b] = [b, a]`
    - When using object literal destructuring assignment without a declaration, parentheses are required:
      ```
      var a, b;
      ({a, b} = {a: 1, b: 2});
      ```
      - vs. `{a, b} = {a: 1, b: 2}`
        - `{a, b}` is evaluated as a block and not an object literal.
    - Destructuring can be used to unpack a property from an object and assign it to a variable with a different name.

      ```
      var o = {p: 42, q: true};
      var {p: foo, q: bar} = o;

      console.log(foo); // 42
      console.log(bar); // true
      ```

    - Nested object and array destructuring:

      ```
      const metadata = {
        title: 'Scratchpad',
        translations: [
          {
            locale: 'de',
            localization_tags: [],
            last_edit: '2014-04-14T08:43:37',
            url: '/de/docs/Tools/Scratchpad',
            title: 'JavaScript-Umgebung'
          }
        ],
        url: '/en-US/docs/Tools/Scratchpad'
      };

      let {
        title: englishTitle, // rename
        translations: [
          {
            title: localeTitle, // rename
          },
        ],
      } = metadata;

      console.log(englishTitle); // "Scratchpad"
      console.log(localeTitle);  // "JavaScript-Umgebung"
      ```

## Controlled Components

- 59
  - Form elements (`<input>`, `<textarea>`, `<select>`) hold their own state in plan HTML.
    - These are considered uncontrolled components, because they handle their own state.
    - In React, we only want controlled components.
      - To achieve this, we set the `value` attribute of the field.
- Exercises
  - [Forms](https://reactjs.org/docs/forms.html)
    - Controlled component: A element whose value is controlled by React (via `setState()`).
    - With a controlled component, every stat mutation will have an associated handler function.
    - In HTML, a `<textarea>` element is defined by its children; in React, it uses a `value` attribute.
    - Instead of adding a `selected` attribute on an `<option>` child of a `<select>` element, React uses a `value` attribute on the `<select>` element itself.
    - A file input tag (`<input type="file" />`) is an uncontrolled component, since it's read-only.
    - [Formik](https://jaredpalmer.com/formik) offers a complete form solution, including validation, tracking visited fields, and handling submission.
      - It's built on the same principles as controlled components.
  - [react-controlled-components-examples](https://github.com/the-road-to-learn-react/react-controlled-components-examples)

## Split Up Components

- 63
  - The `props` (short for `properties`) object is accessible via the class instance by using `this`. It has all the values passed to the components. This enables components to pass properties down the component tree.

## Composable Components

- 64
  - The `children` prop is used to pass elements (unknown to the component itself) to components from above.
    - This makes it possible to compose components together.
    - Strings, elements, and entire element trees can be passed.
- Exercises
  - [Composition vs Inheritance](https://reactjs.org/docs/composition-vs-inheritance.html)
    - Recommendation: Use composition, rather than inheritance, to reuse code between components.
    - Expecially for components that do not know their children ahead of time, use the `children` prop to pass the children elements directly into their output.
      - If you have multiple 'holes' in your application, consider using additional descriptive props (beyond `children`).
    - Another case for composition: When a more 'specific' component renders a more 'generic' one, configuring it with props.
    - Facebook has not found any cases where they would recommend using inheritance instead of composition.
      - If you want to reuse non-UI functionality, consider extracting it into a JavaScript module (so it can be imported without being extended).
  - [React Component Composition](https://www.robinwieruch.de/react-component-composition/)
    - Composition: The arrangement of ingredients to create something bigger.
    - Everything you do within a function is composition of ingredients and their arrangement. When a function is made up of functions, then it's the composition of functions.
    - Note: [React Testing Tutorial: Test Frameworks & Components Tests](https://www.robinwieruch.de/react-testing-tutorial/)
    - Use the [slot pattern](https://www.robinwieruch.de/react-pass-props-to-component/) when you have more than one child that you want to compose into another component (so the component doesn't have to know ahead of time what will be passed in).
    - React Router - used to compose dynamic components (depending on the selected route) into the Route components.
      - The App component displays a static frame of components that are always visible, but changes the inner content depending on the URL.
      - Advanced patterns for component composition:
        - [Render Props Components](https://www.robinwieruch.de/react-render-props-pattern/)
          - An extension of the slot pattern, where a function returns the thing you want to render (rather than you passing it directly).
        - [Higher-Order Components](https://www.robinwieruch.de/gentle-introduction-higher-order-components/)
          - Receive a component as input and then outputs an enhanced version of it.

## Reusable Components

- 66
  - Using components instead of even relatively simple elements (such as `Button` vs. `button`) can make a big difference in the long run for isolating the impact of changes: a single source of truth.
- 67
  - When a prop is optional, assigning a default value is a more explicit way of indicating such.
- Exercises
  - [How to pass props to components in React](https://www.robinwieruch.de/react-pass-props-to-component/)
    - Props are used to pass data from component to component.
    - Props are read only.
    - There is no way to pass props from a child to a parent component.
      - But you can pass functions from parent to child components. The child can make use of these functions, and the functions may change the state in a parent component (and then the changed state is passed down to the child and the components re-render). -> Lifting the state up
    - The component receiving data as props just receives props. It doesn't differentiate between props or state (or derived properties).
      - Everything incoming is props; everything managed by the component itself is state.
    - Consider using props spreading to spread a whole object with key-value pairs down to a child component.
    - Note: [React prop-types](https://reactjs.org/docs/typechecking-with-proptypes.html) can be used for type checking (even without using TypeScript).
    - Render prop components
      - A render prop is a function passed as a prop (often called `render`, though the name is unimportant). The function receives arguments but also renders JSX.
    - Prop drilling
      - When all the in-between components in a hierarchy need to pass the props along, even though they aren't interested in the props.
      - The slot pattern is one solution.
        - This enables you to distribute the props at a top level to all slotted components.
      - [React's Context API](https://www.robinwieruch.de/react-context-api/) is another solution.
        - Every interested component can consume the props passed by React's Context API.
    - How to set props to state?
      - Initial state can simply be derived from props.
      - For incoming, changing props, use the `getDerivedStateFromProps(props, state)` lifecycle method. Use this selectively; think twice about the implementation logic before using it. See [You Probably Don't Need Derived State](https://reactjs.org/blog/2018/06/07/you-probably-dont-need-derived-state.html)
    - The `key` itself cannot be passed as a prop (_key is not a prop. Trying to pass it..._); but its value can be passed as an additional prop.
    - When using [styled components](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components), the style becomes co-located with the components (and actually becomes a component, itself).
      - To pass (beyond the default) props to a styled component, you can use string interpretation in the template literal.
    - For routing, use React Router (an [essential React library](https://www.robinwieruch.de/essential-react-libraries-framework/)); also consider using the `withRouter()` HOC from React Router.

## Component Declarations

- 69
  - Types of components
    - Functional Stateless Components
      - Input: props
      - Output: a component instance in JSX
      - Stateless: No local state
      - No `this` object
      - No lifecycle methods (except for `render()`, which is applied implicitly).
    - ES6 Class Components
      - Extend from the React component (and brings in all the lifecycle methods available in the React component API).
      - Provides access to `this.state` and `this.setState()`.
    - React.createClass
      - Used in older versions of React; deprecated.
  - Rule of thumb: Use functional stateless components by default; if you need local state or component lifecycle methods, refactor it to an ES6 class component.
- 70
  - Best practice: Destructure `props` in the function signature (of a functional stateless component)
  - An implicit `return` is attached in a concise body.
    - This forces `props` as input and JSX as output.
    - Though a block body can be used to make space for doing something else first (and then specifying `return()`).
- Exercises
  - [Components and Props](https://reactjs.org/docs/components-and-props.html)
    - Always start component names with a capital letter; React treats components starting with lowercase letters as DOM tags.
    - Name props from the component's point of view rather than the context in which it's being used.
    - All React components must act like pure functions with respect to their props.

## Styling Components

- 77
  - React styling options to consider
    - [styled-components](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components)
      - [styled-components.com](https://www.styled-components.com/)
    - [CSS Modules](https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules)
      - [create-react-app with CSS Modules](https://www.robinwieruch.de/create-react-app-css-modules/)
        - When using `create-react-app`, CSS modules work out of the box - but thefiles need to be named `.module.css`.
    - [Saas](https://sass-lang.com/)
      - [create-react-app with Sass](https://www.robinwieruch.de/create-react-app-with-sass-support/)
        - When using `create-react-app` and installing Sass (`npm install node-sass --save`), no additional configuration is necessary to enable Sass support.
    - UI Libraries
      - [Semantic UI](https://www.robinwieruch.de/react-semantic-ui-tutorial/)
        - `npm install semantic-ui-react`
        - `import 'semantic-ui-css/semantic.min.css';`
          - In React entry point file where React hooks into the DOM.
      - Material UI
  - For someone new to React, Robin's recommends sticking with pure CSS and inline styles.

## Lifecycle Methods

- 80
  - Lifecycle methods can be used in ES6 class components, but not functional stateless components
  - Mounting
    - `constructor()`
      - Set an initial component state
      - Bind class methods
    - `getDerivedStateFromProps(props, state)`
      - Should return an object to update the state, or null to update nothing
      - Only for rare cases (when the state depends on changes in props over time)
      - Static method; no access to instance
    - `render()`
      - Mandatory
      - Should be pure
    - `componentDidMount()`
      - Good time for asynchronous API requests
  - Updating (due to state/props change)
    - `getDerivedStateFromProps()`
    - `shouldComponentUpdate(nextProps, nextState)`
      - Always called when component updates due to state or props changes
      - Useful for performance optimization in mature apps
      - Return a boolean, indicating whether or not the component should render
    - `render()`
    - `getSnapshotBeforeUpdate(prevProps, prevState)`
      - Invoked before the most recently rendered output is committed to the DOM
      - Useful in rare cases when the component needs to capture information from the DOM before it is potentially changed.
    - `componentDidUpdate(prevProps, prevState, snapshot)`
      - Invoked immediately after rendering (but not for the initial render).
      - Useful for DOM operations or for additional asynchronous requests.
      - Receives returned value from `getSnapshotBeforeUpdate()` (as `snapshot` parameter), if implemented.
  - Unmounting
    - `componentWillUnmount()`
      - Useful for cleanup tasks
  - Error handling
    - `componentDidCatch(error, info)`
      - Introduced in React 16 as a way to catch errors in components.
- Exercises
  - [React.Component](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-component.html)
    - The only method you must defined in a React.Component subclass is `render()`.
    - `static getDerivedStateFromError()`
    - [Lifecycle Diagram](http://projects.wojtekmaj.pl/react-lifecycle-methods-diagram/)
    - `render()`
      - Should not modify component state, should return the same result each time it's invoked, and should not directly interact with the browser.
    - `constructor(props)`
      - If you don't initialize state and you don't bind methods, you don't need to implement a constructor.
      - Call `super(props)` before any other statement.
      - Two purposes:
        - Initialize local state (by setting `this.state`; do not use `setState()` in the constructor)
        - Bind event handler methods to an instance.
      - Do not copy props into state (unless you want to ignore prop updates: in that case, rename it).
    - `componentDidMount()`
      - Initialization requiring DOM nodes should go here
      - Good place for instantiating network requests to load data from a remote endpoint.
      - Good place to set up subscriptions
        - Remember to unsubscribe in `componentWillUnmount()`
      - Can call `setState()` immediately; but it will trigger an extra rendering.
        - Because it happens before the browser updates the screen, the user won't see the intermediate state.
        - Hurts performance. You should ususally be able to set the initial state in the `constructor()`. But this can be useful when working with modals and tooltips that need to measure a DOM node before rendering something that depends on its size or position.
    - `componentDidUpdate(prevProps, prevState, snapsho)`
      - Useful for an opportunity to operate on the DOM where the component has been updated.
      - Good place for network requests (as long as you compare current vs. previous props, since they may have not changed and a network request may be unnecessary).
      - Can call `setState()` immediately, but it must be wrapped in a condition to compare props - otherwise, an infinite loop will result.
    - `componentWillUnmount()`
      - Perform any cleanup here (invalidating timers, cancelling network requests, unsubscribing)
      - Do not call `setState()`, since the component will never be re-rendered.
    - Rare methods
      - `shouldComponentUpdate(nextProps, nextState)`
        - Performanc optimization
        - Lets React know if a component's output is not affected by a change in state or props.
          - Doing deep equality checks or using `JSON.stringify()` will hurt performance.
        - Consider using [PureComponent](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-api.html#reactpurecomponent) instead.
      - `static getDerivedStateFromProps(props, state)`
        - Might be handy for a Transition component.
        - Simpler alternatives
          - Perform a side effect: use `componentDidUpdate()`
          - Re-compute some data only when a prop changes: use a [memoization helper](https://reactjs.org/blog/2018/06/07/you-probably-dont-need-derived-state.html#what-about-memoization)
          - Reset some state when a prop changes: use a [fully-controlled](https://reactjs.org/blog/2018/06/07/you-probably-dont-need-derived-state.html#recommendation-fully-controlled-component) or [fully-uncontrolled with a key](https://reactjs.org/blog/2018/06/07/you-probably-dont-need-derived-state.html#recommendation-fully-uncontrolled-component-with-a-key) component
      - `getSnapshotBeforeUpdate(prevProps, prevState)`
        - Could be useful for capturing some information about the DOM, such as scroll position (e.g., in a chat thread), before the most recently rendered output is committed to the DOM.
    - Error boundaries
      - Catch JavaScript errors anywhere in the child tree (during rendering, in lifecycle methods, and in constructors), and display a fallback UI instead of the component tree that crashed.
      - A class component becomes an error boundary if it defines either `static getDerivedStateFromError()` or `componentDidCatch()`
      - Note that an error boundary cannot catch an error in itself, but only in components below it.
      - `getDerivedStateFromError()`
        - Called during render phase; no side-effects permitted
      - `componentDidCatch(error, info)`
        - Called during commit phase; side-effects are permitted (such as for logging errors)
    - Other APIs
      - `setState(updater[, callback])`
        - A request, rather than an immeidate command to update the component. React may delay and batch updates.
        - If a state value is needed immediately after calling `setState()`, use `componentDidUpdate()` or the `setState()` callback.
          - General recommendation: Use `componentDidUpdate()` instead.
      - `forceUpdate()`
        - Avoid use if possible. Skips `shouldComponentUpdate()`.
    - Class Properties
      - `defaultProps`
        - Sets default props for the class.
        - Used for undefined props, but not for null props.
      - `displayName`
        - Used in debugging messages.
        - Not usually needed; can be useful when you want to display a different name than the function/class or when creating higher-order components.
    - Instance Properties
      - `props`
        - `this.props` contains the props that were defined by the caller of this component.
        - `this.props.children` is a special prop (defined by child tags in JSX rather than the tag itself)
      - `state`
        - Contains data specific to this component that may change over time.
        - User-defined; should be a plain JavaScript object.
        - If a value is not used for rendering or data flow, define it as a field on the component instance (instead of using state).
  - [State and Lifecycle](https://reactjs.org/docs/state-and-lifecycle.html)
  - [Error Handling in React 16](https://reactjs.org/blog/2017/07/26/error-handling-in-react-16.html)
    - Error boundaries are React components that catch JavaScript errors anywhere in their child component tree, log those errors, and display a fallback UI instead of the component tree that crashed. Error boundaries catch errors during rendering, in lifecycle methods, and in constructors of the whole tree below them.
    - A class component becomes an error boundary if it defines a new lifecycle method called `componentDidCatch(error, info)`.
    - Only class components can be error boundaries.
    - Typically, you'll declare a single error boundary component and use it throughout an app.
    - As of React 16, errors that were not caught by any error boundary will result in unmounting of the whole React component tree.
    - React 16 prints all errors during rendering to the console in development; this must be disabled in production.
    - `try` / `catch` only works for imperative code; with the declarative nature of React, error boundaries are more fitting.

## Fetching Data

- 83
  - Lifecycle method in which to fetch data: `componentDidMount()`
- 85
  - Mandatory step in a native fetch with JSON data structures: Response is transformed into a JSON data structure (`.json()`).
- 86
  - In addition to the native fetch API (supported by most browsers - as is confirmed by `create-react-app`), [axios](https://github.com/axios/axios) is another option.
- Exercises

  - [Template literals](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Template_literals)
    - Template literals: Previously known as 'template strings'
    - Escape a back-tick with a backslach `\`
    - Any newline characters inserted are part of the template literal.
    - Template literals can be nested
    - Tagged templates allow you to parse template literals with a function.
      - The first argument to the tag function provides a `raw` argument, giving access to the strings as they were entered (before processing escape sequences).
      - See also `String.raw`
  - [Fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API)
    - Similar to `XMLHttpRequest`, but with a more powerful and flexible feature set.
    - `fetch()` takes one mandatory argument: the path to the resource you want to fetch
      - A secondal option `init` object allows you to control a number of settings
    - It returns a `Promise` that resolves to the `Response` to that request.
  - [How to fetch data in React](https://www.robinwieruch.de/react-fetching-data/)

    - Determining which component in a hierarchy should fetch data from an API depends on:
      - #1: Who is interested in the data?
        - The fetching component should be a common parent.
      - #2: Where do you want to show a conditional loading indicator when the fetched data from the asynchronous request is pending?
        - Such as in a common parent. Or at a higher level. Or the loading indicator could be passed to the children.
      - #3: Where do you want to show an optional error message when the request fails?
        - Similar criteria as for #2.
    - Most minimal example to fetch data:

    ```
    import React, { Component } from 'react';

    class App extends Component {
      constructor(props) {
        super(props);

        this.state = {
          data: null,
        };
      }

      componentDidMount() {
        fetch('https://api.mydomain.com')
          .then(response => response.json())
          .then(data => this.setState({ data }));
      }

      ...
    }

    export default App;
    ```

    - Note: [How to fetch data with React Hooks?](https://www.robinwieruch.de/react-hooks-fetch-data/)
    - Things you might want to store in your state:
      - Fetched data
      - Loading state
        - Toggle an `isLoading` property fron `false` to `true`; in `render()`, conditionally display the loading state based on `isLoading`.
      - Error state
        - When using promises, use `catch()` to handle errors and set the error state flag.
          - Note, though, that the native fetch API doesn't use its catch block for every erroneous status code (e.g., 404). You can force it to go to `catch()` by throwing an error when the response doesn't match the expected data (e.g., `if (response.ok) { return response.json(); } else { throw new Error('Something went wrong...');}`)
          - And, similar to above, show the error message via conditional rendering.
    - `axios` (`npm install axios`) is a great alternative library for fetching data.
      - It already returns a JSON response (so the `.json()` step is unnecessary).
      - All errors are caught in the `catch()` block.
    - Robin's testing recommendations
      - Jest

## ES6 Spread Operators

- 87
  - ES6's `Object.assign()` takes a target object as a first argument (can be an empty object); all additional arguments are source objects that get merged into the target object.
    - Because no source object gets mutated, it embraces immutability.
- 88
  - But a simpler way to achieve this is with the ES6 spread operator: It takes every value from an array or object and copied it to another array or object.
    - The object spread oberator is already being used in the React community and has been incorporated into `create-react-app`.
- Exercises
  - [Object.assign()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/assign)
    - It also returns the target object.
    - Later sources' properties will overwrite earlier ones.
    - Because it assigns properties (vs. copying or defining new properties), it may be unsuitable for merging new properties into a protype if the merge sources contain getters.
      - Consider using `Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor()` and `Object.defineProperty()` instead.
    - Not suitable for deep cloning (since if the source value is a reference to an object, it only copies that reference value).
      - Vs. `let obj3 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(obj1));`
  - [Spread syntax](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Spread_syntax)
    - For object literals (new in ECMAScript 2018): `let objClone = { ...obj };`
    - The spread operator can be used where formerly `.apply()` was necessary for using the elements of an array as arguments to a function.
    - May be unsuitable for copying multidimensional arrays.
    - `Object.assign()` triggers setters, whereas the spread syntax does not.
    - Rest syntax looks exactly like spread syntax; but rest syntax is sortof the opposite of spread syntax
      - spread: expands an array into its elements
      - rest: collects multiple elements and condenses them into a single element.
